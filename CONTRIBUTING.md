# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to Software Engineering deadlines! Please follow these rules to ensure consistency and clarity in the repository.

## Submission Deadlines

1. **Paper Submission Deadline Only**:  
   - Please only include the **paper submission deadline** on the main page.

2. **Abstract Submission Deadline as Notes**:  
   - If a track has separate abstract submission deadline, please mention the abstract submission deadline as a **note** (e.g., "note: Mandatory abstract submission deadline on [date]").  
   - We consider the submission deadline as the final deadline, hence is the deadline submitted within the page.

3. **Exclude Non-Author Deadlines**:  
   - Currently we are not including other types of deadlines such as notification, camera-ready, or other administrative deadlines. Hence, do not include such dates.

## Formatting

- Ensure all dates are clear and accurate.  
- Use consistent formatting for dates (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`).  

By adhering to these guidelines, you help maintain a clean and focused repository for everyone. Thank you for your cooperation!
