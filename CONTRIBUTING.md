# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to Software Engineering deadlines! Please follow these simple rules to ensure consistency and clarity in our repository.

## Submission Deadlines

1. **Paper Submission Deadline Only**:  
   - Please only include the **paper submission deadline** on the main page.

2. **Abstract Submission Deadline as Notes**:  
   - If a track has separate abstract submission deadline, please mention the abstract submission deadline as a **note** (e.g., "note: Mandatory abstract submission deadline on [date]").  
   - We do not consider the abstract submission deadline as a primary deadline.

3. **Exclude Non-Author Deadlines**:  
   - Do not include deadlines such as notification, camera-ready, or other administrative dates.

## Formatting

- Ensure all dates are clear and accurate.  
- Use consistent formatting for dates (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`).  

By adhering to these guidelines, you help maintain a clean and focused repository for all our users. Thank you for your cooperation!
